# TLDR
No longer maintained.

# Notes

This is an initial prototype fork to convert the [Predix UI](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/components/px-map/) Polymer
component based on Leaflet to use the [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) library, using Vector
Tiles.

However, the differences between Mapbox GL and Leaflet are different enough that this will never become a pull request,
and it no longer makes sense to continue developing it as such.

Therefore, this project is no longer maintained, but will kept around for legacy reasons - for any current build
dependencies.


# Original px-map

The original px-map project is an awesome project that uses Leaflet for creating maps using Polymer components.  Check
it out!
